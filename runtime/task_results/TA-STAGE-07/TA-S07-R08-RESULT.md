# TA-S07-R08 Result

## Stage

TA-STAGE-07

## Round

TA-S07-R08 - 试运营交付

## Completed Work

Implemented through the independent travel-agency module: local QA matrix, isolation checks, performance-ready test fixture, regression verification, and confirmation gates for deploy/upload/backup.

This round is covered without rewriting the existing carrier-company admin, dispatch, driver, or operations-manager core flows.
